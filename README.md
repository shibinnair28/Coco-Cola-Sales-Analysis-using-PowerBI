# Analysis of Coca-Cola Sales Data Using Power BI

## Project Overview

Coca-Cola, one of the world's largest and most successful beverage companies, offers a diverse range of products including carbonated soft drinks, juices, water, and energy drinks. With operations in over 200 countries, Coca-Cola is continuously seeking ways to enhance its business performance.

This project focuses on analyzing Coca-Cola's sales data by creating a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard using Power BI. The goal is to provide insights into the company's sales performance, identify trends, and suggest areas for improvement.

## Insights from the Dashboard

- **Monthly Sales Variations:**
  - Sales are highest in July, possibly due to summer promotions or increased demand for cold beverages. There is a noticeable decline towards the end of the year, which may warrant further investigation.

- **Best Performing Regions:**
  - Sales are strongest in the West, followed by the Northeast, indicating a strong market presence in these areas. The Midwest shows the lowest sales, presenting an opportunity for market expansion or increased marketing efforts.

- **Product Performance:**
  - Coca-Cola is the best-selling product with 4.1M units, followed by Diet Coke and Dasani Water, each at 3M units. This insight is crucial for inventory and production planning to ensure that popular products are well-stocked.

- **Geographical Sales Distribution:**
  - New York and California each contribute 0.58M units in sales, suggesting a concentrated market in these states. Strategies to replicate this success in other states could be beneficial.

- **Cost Analysis:**
  - The dashboard includes a comparison of total operating costs, reflecting profitability across different products and regions. The average operating cost is also presented as a benchmark for cost management.
