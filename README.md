# Coca-Cola Sales Data Analysis Using Power BI

## Key Features of the Dashboard

- **Track Sales Performance Over Time:**
  - This dashboard shows how the sales figures of Coca-Cola have evolved during different months. The "Sales by Month" bar chart depicts the trend in monthly sales, indicating periods of high and low sales.

- **Identify Trends and Patterns:**
  - The dashboard examines sales data to uncover key trends, such as the highest sales months and the most lucrative product categories. The "Units Sold by Beverage Brand" chart visualizes which products generate the most sales, with Coca-Cola leading at 4.1M units.

- **Compare Sales Across Regions, Products, and Channels:**
  - The "Total Sales by Region" bar chart highlights the contribution of each region to overall performance. The dashboard provides comparative analytics across various products and states, with New York and California leading in sales.

- **Identify Areas for Improvement:**
  - The "Top Cities by Total Sales" and "Top 5 States by Sales" charts provide insights into underperforming geographic regions. These areas, such as the Midwest and South, can be targeted for improvement campaigns to boost sales.

## Insights from the Dashboard

- **Monthly Sales Variations:**
  - Sales are highest in July, possibly due to summer promotions or increased demand for cold beverages. There is a noticeable decline towards the end of the year, which may warrant further investigation.

- **Best Performing Regions:**
  - Sales are strongest in the West, followed by the Northeast, indicating a strong market presence in these areas. The Midwest shows the lowest sales, presenting an opportunity for market expansion or increased marketing efforts.

- **Product Performance:**
  - Coca-Cola is the best-selling product with 4.1M units, followed by Diet Coke and Dasani Water, each at 3M units. This insight is crucial for inventory and production planning to ensure that popular products are well-stocked.

- **Geographical Sales Distribution:**
  - New York and California each contribute 0.58M units in sales, suggesting a concentrated market in these states. Strategies to replicate this success in other states could be beneficial.
